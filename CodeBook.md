# Code book for the script run_analysis.R

## Requirements
This script should be run from directory "UCI HAR Dataset"; the following files 
are used by the script and should be downloaded and unzipped before running it:

On directory "UCI HAR Dataset":
- activity_labels.txt
- features.txt

On subdirectory test:
- test/y_test.txt
- test/X_test.txt
- test/subject_test.txt

On subdirectory train:
- train/y_train.txt
- train/X_train.txt
- train/subject_train.txt

## Tasks required of this script:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
   for each activity and each subject. 

## Results of this script
The first 4 tasks are completed with the definition of object HAR 
('data.frame': 10299 obs. of  81 variables).

The second data set as required by task #5 is defined as data frame "result" 
('data.frame': 180 obs. of  81 variables) and exported as file 
'Averages_by_Activity_and_Subject.txt' on directory 'UCI HAR Dataset'.

This is the list of columns used in both dataframes, the first two are factors 
for activity and subject code, the remaining 79 are the results of functions 
calculating mean and standard deviations taken from files 'X_train' and 'X_test':

81. fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-meanFreq()

These observations were chosen because the Mean measurements have the string 
"mean" in their name and the Standard deviation columns have the string "std".
The file 'features_info.txt' explains the logic for the column names of the 
'X_test' and 'X_train' files. 

The exported file has the mean of the observations as the data frame HAR broken 
up by the activity description and the code of the subject.
